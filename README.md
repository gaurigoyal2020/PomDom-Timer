<h2>Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extention</h2>
<p>This is an aesthetic Pomodoro Timer Chrome Extention to help with productivity.</p>
<p><b>It allows us to run the pomodoro timer without needing to open an app in the background or a seperate tab in the browser.</b></p>
<p>We have a "Focus Time" set to 25 mins which, according to reseach is the most apt focus span for someone with ADHD.</p>
<p>Then we have a "Short Break Timer" of 5 mins to allow time for refreshing the vibes but more importantly to take break from screen time~</p>
<p>Finally we have a 15 min "Long Break" which is to be used generally after at least 2 focus bursts.</p>
<p>Following is a screenshot of the timer working on "Focus".</p>
