## üí° Known Limitations

üö´ **Focus Mode / Do Not Disturb (DND) suppresses system notifications**

> If you're using macOS "Focus" or Windows "Focus Assist" / DND mode, Chrome's system notifications (like PomDom's alert) **will not appear**. This is a platform-level behavior and cannot be bypassed by extensions for security and sanity reasons.

**Tips to mitigate:**
- Use Chrome‚Äôs built-in notification center (`chrome://flags/#enable-message-center-new-style`) on some platforms.
- Keep the popup open if you want to manually track the timer visually.
